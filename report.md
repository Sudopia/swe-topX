#### Project Goals:
To determine the most frequent computer security weaknesses encountered in the wild. This will allow me to publish a report of issues for software development teams to mitigate. I will determine the size of my list of weaknesses once I have looked at the data and minimized some security weakness classification categories.

#### Project Description: 
When a novel security vulnerability is discovered, a Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) record is sent to and published the Mitre corporation who then adds it to their CVE database which is provided for public use. Other organizations such as the National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) provide copies of the Mitre CVE database and even add additional info such as risk evaluations and alternative file types for download. So in order to determine the frequency of security weaknesses, I downloaded from NIST, JSON formatted data feeds containing CVE records for the last 5 years. This includes data from the years 2013-2017. The field of data I gathered from each of the CVE records is the ID number of the CWE(s) that the CVE was classified under. A CWE, or common weakness enumeration, serves to describe what category of security weakness allowed a vulnerability described in a CVE to occur.

I then counted the frequency of each CWE encountered in my dataset. CWE classifications can be too specific in some cases where they are used to describe a given common problem as applied to a specific software vendor's product. Since the problem is the same regardless of the vendor, including vendor specific CWEs sometimes contributes to the sprawl of classification categories. Further, some CWE descriptions are very similar to other CWEs. Sometimes these CWEs can be merged into a slightly more general CWE and associated weakness title. The idea is that if I can minimize or condense CWE listings then I can provide software development teams with a more actionable software weakness list for them to consider for mitigation.

#### Project Tools:
I wrote two python scripts: one to count the CWEs and write the CWE IDs and associated frequencies into a comma separated file (CSV), the other to display a couple simple bar graphs of the frequencies. For the latter, I included a bar graph of the actual frequency of each CWE as well as a relative frequency bar graph showing the percentage of the total number of CWEs that each ID instance comprises.
